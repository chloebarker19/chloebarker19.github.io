### 1.	Let the user read in the data (the Beer Data.) 
### 2.	Let the user make a histogram of the IBU
### 3.	Let the user make a histogram of the ABV  (separate histogram)
### 4.	Low the user switch back and forth between histograms and boxplots to represent this information.  You could do this with a radio button that switches the plot from histogram to boxplot â€¦ the implementation however is up to you.  
### 5.	Allow the user to filter the histograms / boxplots above by state. 
### 6.	In addition to the histograms, add a scatter plot of IBU v. ABV
### 7.	Add the ability to add or take off the simple linear regression line. 
### 8.	Allow the user to filter the data on the scatter plot by state.
###9.	Add at least one additional plot from your analysis and make sure to clearly label and/or describe the information it is conveying.  
### 10.	Publish your app to ShinyApps.io
